# Guess-Who-Board-Sim-V2
better engine, dont know about performance though

this is for creating the guess-who board automatically from a set folder of images

To prepare:  
Step 1: Prepare the folders with the images you wanted  
Step 2: Name the images files with the name you want (keep in mind it will be used later)  
Step 3: Download the .exe file  
Step 4: Open the program and select the folder and let the program do its work  

Note: You might need to adjust the size of your window to make sure you can see all the images  
Image supported formats: ('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif', '.bmp', '.webp')  
Be aware that your images will be shrunk to fit the grid so the resolution of the image might be worse compared to the original  
Keep in mind you might need to resize your window so you can see the image grid actually fits.
